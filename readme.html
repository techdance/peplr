<h2>Quick Start</h2>

<p>To get up and running quickly, follow the steps below:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Download a <a href="http://liferay.com/downloads">pre-built Liferay Portal release</a>.
For starters, it's recommended to choose Liferay Portal bundled with Tomcat.</p></li>
<li><p>Download and install
<a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html">Java (JDK) 8</a>
(if necessary) in your local environment.</p></li>
<li><p>Extract the downloaded pre-built Liferay Portal bundle into a folder.</p></li>
<li><p>Navigate to the bundle's <code>liferay-ce-portal-[version]/tomcat-[version]/bin</code>
folder and execute <code>startup.bat</code> (Windows) or <code>startup.sh</code> (Unix/Linux/Mac OS
X), depending on your operating system.</p></li>
<li><p>A server console opens, which starts your Liferay Portal instance. Once your
instance is ready to use, the portal URL address (http://localhost:8080) is
automatically opened in your default browser.</p></li>
<li><p>You're presented a Basic Configuration page. Complete the configuration
options.</p>

<p>Liferay Portal uses an embedded database (HSQL) to make installation fast
and easy. This database is not ready for production, so consider configuring
a production-ready database (e.g., MySQL) if you plan on doing more than
just exploring/testing.</p></li>
<li><p>Agree to the terms and conditions, create a password, and configure a
security question/answer.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>You can now use Liferay Portal!</p>
